            <h2>Common Vulnerabilities Explored</h2>
            <p>This CTF introduces some common security vulnerabilities and tricks that hackers use to gather information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> A common web vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into a webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML Comments Leak:</strong> Sensitive data or clues are hidden in HTML comments, accessible only when viewing the page source.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript Obfuscation:</strong> Scripts that mask their purpose, hiding crucial information within JavaScript code.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each vulnerability has clues hidden on the site, helping you develop your skills in a structured way.</p>
