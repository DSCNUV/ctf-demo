            <p>You've entered the world of Cyber Sleuth, a land where only the sharpest minds and the most skilled digital detectives can unlock hidden secrets. This Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge is not for the faint-hearted; it’s designed to sharpen your cyber skills. Here, you’ll find yourself navigating through various web pages, each holding a piece of the puzzle. Will you be able to solve the riddles hidden in plain sight, in the very code that builds this digital world?</p>
            <p>The challenges are hidden across multiple pages, each with subtle clues and hidden messages. Your task is simple: uncover these secrets and capture the flags.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To begin, familiarize yourself with the site. Each page has something to offer, whether it’s a clue, a misdirection, or even a hidden flag waiting for you to find it. As a beginner, don’t worry if you feel lost. Start by inspecting each page’s content carefully. Remember, a true cyber sleuth leaves no stone unturned.</p>
            <p>CTFs often involve knowing where to look. Right-click on the page, inspect the HTML, view the JavaScript, and look for anything out of place.</p>

            <h2>Useful Tools for Your Journey</h2>
            <p>Throughout this CTF, you'll find yourself needing various tools and resources. Here are some that might come in handy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inspect Element: Access it by right-clicking and choosing "Inspect" or pressing F12. This tool lets you dig deeper into HTML and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Console: Located in the Inspect panel, the Console will help you see hidden messages that may not appear on the page itself.</li>
                <li>Base64 Decoders: If you come across encoded text, an online Base64 decoder may reveal a hidden message.</li>
                <li>Text Editors: Use a text editor like Notepad++ to search for hidden flags or clues.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Important Hints</h2>
            <p>1. If a page seems empty, think again! Check the comments within the HTML. Sometimes the best clues are hidden right in the code.</p>
            <p>2. Look out for encoding and obfuscation techniques. CTF challenges often use encoded messages. Familiarize yourself with tools that can decode base64, hex, or even binary-encoded messages.</p>
            <p>3. JavaScript consoles can reveal more than just errors. Developers often use `console.log` for debugging, but sometimes it's used to hide clues for clever users.</p>
            <p>4. Don’t ignore any part of the page; sometimes, the color of a link, the style of a header, or even the alt text on an image can contain a crucial hint.</p>
